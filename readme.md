# Godot Minesweeper Clone
A simple Minesweeper-inspired game built with [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org).
This was made with the goal of improving my Godot skills, and I'm sharing it in hope that my code serves as an inspiration to other aspiring game devs, feel free to copy, share, redistribute, or do anything you want with it.

If you want to reach out to me for whichever reason, my social are linked at the top of this page, and my dms are open :).

I'll be uploading more games in the future, so please follow if you want to be notified.
